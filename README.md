# HTML and JavaScript Example: Rectangle Calculator
This is a basic HTML and JavaScript example that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle based on user input. The example demonstrates how to take user input, perform calculations, and display the results using HTML and JavaScript.

## Usage
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. You'll be prompted to enter the width and height of a rectangle.
3. Enter valid numeric values for both the width and height when prompted. Ensure that the values are greater than 0.
4. After entering the values, the program will calculate and display the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
5. If either the width or height is not a valid numeric value or is less than or equal to 0, the program will prompt you to enter a valid value.

## Features
- **Area Calculation**: The program calculates and displays the area of the rectangle using the formula: `area = width * height`.
- **Perimeter Calculation**: The program calculates and displays the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula: `perimeter = 2 * (width + height)`.
- **User Input Validation**: The program checks whether the input values are valid numeric values greater than 0 and provides feedback to the user.

## How It Works
1. The program uses JavaScript to take user input for the width and height of the rectangle.
2. It performs calculations for both area and perimeter based on the user's input.
3. It displays the results in the web page using the `document.write()` function.
4. User input validation is included to ensure valid numeric values and feedback to the user when invalid values are provided.

## Customization
You can modify the HTML and JavaScript code to change the behavior or appearance of the calculator. This example can serve as a starting point for creating similar calculators or interactive forms in your web applications.
